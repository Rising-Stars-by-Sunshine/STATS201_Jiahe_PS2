The proposed method aims to investigate the relationship between obesity levels and lung cancer incidence using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a cross-sectional dataset sourced from Cancer Data World and Kaggle, the study seeks to identify patterns or correlations between different levels of obesity and the likelihood of developing low, medium, or high levels of lung cancer. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide insights for public health and oncology, offering implications for preventive measures and interventions amidst the rising global prevalence of obesity. The hypothesis posits that higher levels of obesity are associated with an increased likelihood or severity of lung cancer, grounded in existing literature attributing obesity as a potential risk factor for the disease. The machine learning workflow entails data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and AUC scores, with iterative refinement strategies for enhancing predictive accuracy and generalizability.
